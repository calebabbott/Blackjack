# BLACKJACK
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Blackjack card game, where players compete against the house. 
It includes interactive gameplay features like automatic card dealing, Ace value handling, and game state tracking (busts, BlackJack, and win conditions). 
The game offers a fun and engaging way to simulate Blackjack while reinforcing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills, making it a useful tool for learning and entertainment.
